build on blockly

when i working on configurate blockly for matatacode, i always wondering ï¼Œis this the best to describe programming or coding to kids?

i think blockly is great and has a very friendly GUI for people, not just for kids. but it's very hard to show some hardcore ideas, like multi-threads, or inception.

It's too simple for program

i'd make a list about what i like to add in Blockly
+ it is NOT only for kids
+ Multi-threads
+ inception
+ clock
+ value pool
+ runtime 
+ promise
+ event bus
+ ...

As STEM Education going so wild, it's very hard for people to understand that their children's biggest problem with learning programming is the children's parents knows shit.

So there must be something, with can be spread on SNS and easy to creat lots of fun.

Release the creative of people then the STEM will start to become a real thing.

otherwise, when the kids get older, they will find out 80% they learned back in STEM is useless, just like their parents did, which is in university.
